Welcome to MemoCard! ðŸŽ´

MemoCard is a simple, fun, and slightly addictive card memory game built with React and Vite. If youâ€™ve ever wanted to test your memory, challenge your friends, or just kill a few minutes with something lighthearted, youâ€™re in the right place.

## What is MemoCard?

MemoCard is a game where you try to click each card only once. Every time you click a new card, your score goes up. But if you click the same card twice, your score resets and you have to start over! The goal is to get all 12 cards without repeating any. Itâ€™s harder than it sounds, especially when the cards shuffle after every click!

## Why did I make this?

Honestly, I wanted to brush up on my React skills and make something thatâ€™s actually fun to play. Iâ€™ve always loved memory games (and PokÃ©mon, which youâ€™ll notice in the images), so this was a perfect excuse to combine both. Plus, itâ€™s a great way to take a break from more serious projects and just enjoy coding for the sake of it.

## How to Play

1. Click any card to start.
2. Each time you click a new card, your score increases.
3. If you click a card youâ€™ve already picked, your score resets to zero.
4. Try to get all 12 cards without repeating any!
5. The cards shuffle every time you click, so stay sharp!

## A Few Words
