**Test your memory. Beat your best. Have a laugh when you fail.**

MemoCard isn’t just another coding project—it’s a quick, punchy memory game that’ll trip you up and make you want to try again. The rules are simple: click each card only once. If you repeat, your score drops to zero. The cards shuffle every time, so you can’t just coast on luck. Get all 12 and you win. Miss one, and you’re back to square one.

## Why MemoCard?

I built MemoCard because I love games that are easy to start but tough to master. I wanted something that could make you smile, groan, and say “just one more try.” The Pokémon images? That’s just a bonus for anyone who grew up with them (or still loves them).

## How to Play

1. Click any card to begin.
2. Each new card = +1 point.
3. Click a card you’ve already picked? Score resets. Ouch.
4. Get all 12 unique cards and you win. Simple, but not easy.
5. The cards shuffle after every click. Stay sharp.

## Features

- Fast, clean interface
- Scoreboard that keeps you honest
- Pokémon images for a bit of nostalgia
- Responsive and smooth—works on any screen
- No instructions needed. You’ll get it (or you’ll lose, and then you’ll get it)
